an increasing number of climatic episodes, natural catastrophes, and in- dustrial accidents; devastating product recalls; in- formation technology breaches and data security violations; virally disruptive social media trends; and the threat of terrorism (Choucri, Madnick, & Koepke, 2016; Laufer & Coombs, 2006; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005; Ritchie, 2004; Scholtens, 2008; Toubiana & Zietsma, 2016).","8":"Despite the increasing need to better understand crises and crisis management, this stream of research has not played a prominent role in mainstream or- ganization and management theory (Roux-Dufort, 2007; Roux-Dufort & Lalonde, 2013).","9":"Our review reveals that the differ- ences and similarities in how crisis and crisis management are conceptualized and researched in the literature hold important implications for how scholars interpret and understand resilience.","10":"Thus, the crisis–resilience relationship likely provides new insights into how organizations anticipate, adjust, and respond to adversity.","11":"By fusing the two literatures, we lay the groundwork for a research agenda that seeks to extend our understanding of adversity by account- ing for both the crisis management and resilience perspectives.","12":"We then review the crisis management and resilience literatures and illustrate core themes related to organizing in the face of adversity.","13":"Finally, we integrate these themes and offer a research agenda to gain a deeper understanding of how organizations interact with adversity over time to build resilience.","14":"We then manually explored additional research that may have fallen outside of the initial search, focusing on frequently cited domain-specific book chapters, books, and other papers.","15":"ORGANIZATIONAL CRISIS IN THE MANAGEMENT LITERATURE  Management research on crisis has been highly fragmented largely due to a lack of agreement on the definition of the term crisis (Boin, 2004; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005), challenges in observing crises real time (Forgues & Roux-Dufort, 1998), and making comparisons across these unique events (Roux- Dufort, 2016) the evolving definitions, see James, Wooten, & Dushek, 2011).","16":"Despite the fragmentary nature of the crisis  (for a detailed discussion of  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  735  literature, there are two broad conceptualizations of crisis: crisis as an event and crisis as a process.","17":"Many of Hermann’s core ideas are embedded in the definition of crisis that is most frequently cited in the literature today: “a low-probability, high-impact situation that is perceived by critical stakeholders to threaten the viability of the organization” (Pearson & Clair, 1998: 66).","18":"is the unit of analysis and studies typically examine what triggers the event (Lagadec, 2007; Shrivastava, Mitroff, Miller, & Miclani, 1988) and how the event disrupts or threatens organizational survival (Pearson & Clair, 1998; Sayegh, Anthony, & Perrewe, 2004).","19":"A surge of studies exploring shock- ing accidents, such as oil spills (Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992), the Challenger explosion (Starbuck & Milliken, 1988), terrorist attacks (Rosenthal, 2003), and so forth, have further enhanced the event orientation of crisis theorizing.","20":"That is, the goal of crisis management is to bring a system back into alignment, which can only occur in the aftermath of an adverse event.","21":"Indeed, a key benefit of studying crises as events is seeking to understand the dynamics of a crisis in its most acute stage and how organizations react to bring things back into equilib- rium as soon as possible (Lalonde & Roux-Dufort, 2010).","22":"This perspective has given rise to a number of studies exploring interorganizational collaboration, disaster planning and prevention, and emergent organizing as means for addressing crisis-induced needs, with a par- ticular focus on alleviating suffering and preserving life and property (Foster, 2012; Quarantelli, 1997; Shepherd & Williams, 2014).","23":"The crisis-as-event perspective by definition privi- leges research that investigates actors’ reactions to rare and exceptional events, and, in many ways, ne- glects research that aims to understand how the crisis was produced in the first place (Roux-Dufort, 2016; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 1999).","24":"Indeed, recently crisis management scholars (e.g., Quarantelli, 2005; Roux-Dufort, 2007, 2009) have suggested extending the scope of crisis management from a focus on the rare and exceptional event to investigate processes that may lead to a crisis event.","25":"Next, we examine the literature on the process perspective of crises to un- derstand this complementary stream of research.","26":"Crisis as a Process  In contrast  to the event-centered perspective, which focuses primarily on exploring the aftermath of a crisis, the process perspective focuses on the need to understand crisis-fostering environments, processes of organizational weakening (Roux-Dufort, 2007), crisis evolution, and how organizations re- spond to stages of a crisis.","27":"Extending research beyond rare, novel crisis events highlights various forms of adversity organi- zations face and the ways organizations enact, in- teract with, and respond to the environment at different stages of crisis.","28":"Beyond these events, other organizational occurrences hold the potential to develop, accumu- late, and advance to such a degree that they escalate into triggering events.","29":"Interestingly, much of the foundational literature on crisis and crisis management argues for a process definition of crisis.","30":"For example, Rerup’s study (2009) reveals how a merger between two pharmaceutical companies led to a major crisis event when management failed to attend to weak signals (in this case, chain of command issues) over time and across multiple levels of the organizational hierarchy.","31":"Taken together, these studies represent an emerging and important shift in research that explores the in- cubation of crises as well as the evolutionary features of crises (e.g., weakening and strategic drift) that may (or may not) accumulate into a triggering event.","32":"Having reviewed the foundational perspectives of crisis and crisis management, we now discuss the general themes that emerged from our detailed review of the literature.","33":"As we reviewed the literature on crisis and crisis management, we found—consistent with our dis- cussion earlier—that much of the empirical research has focused specifically on the response to crisis events.","34":"In addition, research emphasizing normative approaches to di- sasters has the opportunity to better integrate the numerous ad hoc organizing efforts that inevitably emerge in the aftermath of disasters (e.g., Lanzara,  \f738  Academy of Management Annals  June  1983; Majchrzak, Jarvenpaa, & Hollingshead, 2007; Shepherd & Williams, 2014; Williams & Shepherd, 2016b).","35":"Ad hoc organizing occurs after triggering events as actors spontaneously converge to the scene of the crisis to care for and offer help to alleviate others’ suffering (for a review, see Drabek & McEntire, 2003).","36":"Leadership and Crisis Management  As a natural extension to the previous section on the normative aspects of crisis management, to un- derstand exceptional crisis recovery a substantial body of research has examined the role of effective leadership (James et al., 2011).","37":"In a crisis, some leader- ship styles are considered more effective than others in helping organizations to respond (Ballesteros, Useem, & Wry, in press; Bundy & Pfarrer, 2015; Stam, Van Knippenberg, Wisse & Pieterse, 2016).","38":"Importantly, prior relationships are important in shaping effectiveness of meaning making, where a negative leader–organization relationship can nega- tively affect the organization’s reputation (Coombs & Holladay, 2001).","39":"However, despite the importance of leadership in planning and preparing for a crisis response, de- tailed planning and preparation cannot mitigate every potential crisis (Drabek & McEntire, 2003; Herbane, 2013; Neal & Phillips, 1995; Wenger, Quarantelli, & Dynes, 1990).","40":"Beyond explorations of crisis leadership in respond- ing to disaster events, a small set of studies also consider a more process-oriented approach to crisis management.","41":"Consistent with our earlier statements of research on crisis management in general, research on teams typically assumes the crisis-as-event perspective.","42":"Despite the dominance of this perspective, some studies explore the importance of leveraging multiple stakeholders and decision makers to help organiza- tions attend to and act on organizational imperfec- tions and/or drift before those issues are no longer controllable (Bazerman & Watkins, 2004; Chekkar- Mansouri & Onnee, 2013; Roux-Dufort, 2009).","43":"Advancements in research on crisis management will likely come from integrating event and process crisis research to focus on the weakening or de- generation that precede triggering events (Boin & McConnell, 2007; Roux-Dufort, 2007).","44":"As a result, there is a desire to understand how organizations interpret and absorb various degrees of adversity that hold the potential to accumulate into a triggering event.","45":"This interest has led to a limited-but-promising body of research linking crisis management to resilience (see Aldrich, 2012; Boin & McConnell, 2007; McEntire, 2013; Van Der Vegt et al., 2015; Williams & Shepherd, 2016a).","46":"Following this review, we highlight opportunities to advance both crisis and resilience literature and theory through integration.","47":"This suggests that linking crisis and resilience may provide a more complete understanding of the organization–adversity relationship.","48":"At its roots resilience originally stemmed from resilire and resilio, which in Latin mean “bounce” or “jump back” (Alexander, 2013; Klein, Nicholls, & Thomalla, 2003).","49":"Moreover, the study of resilience in the management and organizations’ literature is fragmented and there is general agreement that although theory surrounding resilience has proliferated, empiri- cal studies have lagged (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015).","50":"A recent Academy of Management Annals paper characterizes occupational resilience as the cognitive, emotional, and physical hardiness required in particular careers (e.g., artists, dancers, doctors, firefighters, teachers) (Kossek & Perrigino, 2016).","51":"As such, advancements in organizational research will likely come by integrating findings across levels.","52":"Taken together, the multilevel and multi-stage nature of resilience is an essential foundation to understand what we know about resilience and how to advance research moving forward.","53":"An Inclusive Definition of Resilience  These definitions highlight some important issues relevant to our analysis and integration.","54":"Importantly, and similar to the crisis management literature, a process definition of resilience accounts for the dynamic nature of resilience as an interaction between the organization and the environment.","55":"Although the conceptual literature has typically fo- cused on building collective capacities, knowledge, skills or abilities for resilience, our review of the empirical literature suggests a more expansive con- figuration.","56":"Prior research has emphasized the importance of appropriately stockpiling resources (e.g., slack) in anticipation of the need to withstand adversity (Bradley, Shepherd, & Wiklund, 2011; Carmeli & Markman, 2011; George, 2005; Hobfoll, 1989; Virany, Tushman, & Romanelli, 1992).","57":"Other studies have considered individuals’ affect regulation and tolerance for stress as indicators of resilience (Bonanno 2004; Leyro, Zvolensky, & Bernstein, 2010).","58":"Emotional ambivalence opens actors to alternative perspectives that can increase judgment accuracy (Rees, Rothman, Lehavy, & Sanchez-Burks, 2013),  enhance cognitive flexibility (Fong, 2006), and assist in the anticipation of and preparation for the un- expected (Vogus et al., 2014).","59":"Similarly, Shepherd and Williams (2014) found that trust and network relationships among disaster- impacted community members were critical in re- sponse to a devastating bushfire.","60":"Despite advancements in our understanding of organizational responses to disaster events, recent studies (Comfort, 1994; Shepherd & Williams, 2014; Van Der Vegt et al., 2015; Williams & Shepherd, 2016a, 2016b) highlight the importance of understanding how organizations can cultivate  predisaster resilience by strengthening preventative measures, including developing networks, coordination techniques (within and between organizations), and individual members’ resilience.","61":"If these teams and organizations fail to appropriately interpret environmental cues and make changes to address shifts in the situation, they are likely to be less resilient to the adverse and complex environments they face (Bigley & Roberts, 2001; Faraj & Xiao, 2006), which can then result in a crisis event.","62":"Responding to Major Disturbances  The third prominent theme in the resilience liter- ature is responding to major disturbances that result from the climax of organizational weakening or surprising external event (e.g., a disaster).","63":"Behavioral responding to a major disturbance is a natural extension of cognitive responding as it involves actors’ enacting solutions or courses of action to address the environmental un- certainty (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005; Rahmandad & Repenning, 2016; Weick, 1993).","64":"As with other aspects of the resilience process, behavioral responses to adversity involve the interaction of multiple factors at various levels.","65":"For example, Bechky and Okhuysen (2011) found that police SWAT teams and film production crews developed critical socio-cognitive resources for managing uncertainty through bricolage, including restructuring activities by role shifting, reorganizing routines, and reassembling work activities.","66":"These creative team actions generated feedback to provide an updated and dynamic perspective on team struc- ture, communication, and collaboration to manage unexpected events.","67":"Context is important in explaining responses to adversity as it provides the foundational setting in which cognitive and behavioral responses are  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  749  enacted and integrated (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005).","68":"This further demonstrates the dynamic and interactive nature of resilience between subjects and the environment.","69":"In combining these streams of research, we highlighted the benefit of exploring resilience as a process of adaptation, improvisation, and recovery, which lends itself to a fusion with the crisis management research.","70":"Because of this common ground, the way crisis and crisis management are conceptualized holds important implications for building theory on resilience, and vice versa.","71":"In Figure 1, we offer a model of the fusion of crisis management and resilience that integrates the major themes identified in the review above and serves as a foun- dation for building a future research agenda.","72":"In the following sections, we highlight five over- arching themes for future research that emphasize the dynamic, process-oriented perspective of crisis and resilience exhibited in Figure 1.","73":"Future Research on Leadership in the Face of Adversity  As noted earlier, research on crisis management has emphasized the importance of postevent lead- ership in helping navigate obstacles generated by adversity to motivate positive action in others (Pearson & Clair, 1998; Quarantelli, 1988, 1996).","74":"(2011) to crisis management and focus on recovery in that it suggests that beyond merely framing an event, leadership is critical to actively facilitating resilience.","75":"First, research on leadership has advanced our understanding of how effective leaders deploy re- sources when taking organizational actions (Walter & Bruch, 2009; Yun, Faraj, & Sims, 2005).","76":"For example, leadership research can build on the sub- stantial literature on trust (Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995) to gain an un- derstanding of how leaders can build trust as an endowment of resilience.","77":"Although we know that trust increases in value during adverse situations (Colquitt et al., 2011), it is critical that we gain a deeper understanding of the nature of trust, with whom that trust resides, and how it is maintained for it to represent an endowment that can be called upon quickly during adversity.","78":"Leadership research can also explore how leaders can design their organiza- tions for greater resilience and/or how different de- signs enable or constrain the types of leadership needed for building resilience.","79":"Perhaps, leaders are more effective when they have a prevention focus when preparing for adversity and a promotion focus when responding to it.","80":"Future research can explore these and other questions in- corporating theories that are fundamental to leader- ship and decision-making.","81":"Although learning from a crisis is likely to be a way to build endowments for resilience, we do not yet fully un- derstand how leaders facilitate the process by which organizations and organizational members learn from  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  753  a crisis in a way that promotes resilience to subsequent adversity.","82":"Integrating crisis management and resilience re- search also brings to the forefront several theoretical mechanisms that they have in common, including time, complexity, and mindfulness.","83":"Future Research on the Role of Time on Adversity  Research has illustrated the importance of con- sidering time for understanding resilience and for understanding crisis management, as some crises continue for an extended period and new crises sometimes emerge after an initial crisis has been managed.","84":"Recent research explored how a news or- ganization created an infrastructure to respond to breaking news stories on a routine basis while maintaining its main objective of producing time- bound newscasts (Patriotta & Gruber, 2015).","85":"Second, although endowments are a resource “stock,” focusing on time enables us to explore the “flow” of resources.","86":"Future research can build on several emerging studies that highlight the benefits of challenging work in the face of adversity (Gorgievski & Hobfoll, 2008; Williams & Shepherd, 2016b) to explore what it takes to maintain and/or update endowments for resilience.","87":"Although there has been some research on accelerating decision speed (Bakker & Shepherd, 2016; Eisenhardt, 1989), we need to gain a deeper understanding of how actors can accelerate their preparations (e.g., risk manage- ment and vulnerability assessments) and their re- sponses to facilitate resilience.","88":"Further- more, research can challenge the assumption that “more speed is better” by exploring if and under what circumstances slowing the organization down may facilitate resilience in the face of certain types of adversity.","89":"Finally, learning from failure can be enhanced by the passage of time—that is, time helps reduce the negative emotions triggered by a failure, which helps reduce obstacles to learning from the experience (Shepherd et al., 2011).","90":"The potential for things to go wrong has increased dramatically along with the concomitant implications of responding to events in forums where the world is watching.","91":"This has important implications for extending foundational work on how organizations anticipate and respond to adversity (Thompson, 1967).","92":"The in- creased degree of environmental complexity chal- lenges traditional organizational mechanisms to detect, respond to, and control ongoing operations.","93":"To date, a considerable body of research focuses on how organizations develop and manage systems to account for and control a range of normal and/or expected disturbances (Cardinal, Sitkin, & Long, 2004, 2010; Carver & Scheier, 1982; Giglioni & Bedeian 1974; Klein, 1989; Snell, 1992).","94":"Despite the long tradition of research exploring systems of control, these studies generally explore systems that are designed for situations that fall outside of the notion of “crisis” discussed throughout this review.","95":"Further complicating the increasing environmental complexity is the shifting power, sa- lience, and urgency of different types of stakeholders over time (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997).","96":"These challenges, if not well managed, may escalate into major disruptions, which could in turn lead to resource withdrawal and even  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  755  organizational demise.","97":"There appear to be ample opportunities to in- tegrate the emerging research on environmental complexity (Greenwood et al., 2011; Wry, Cobb, & Aldrich, 2013) with resilience and crisis manage- ment studies.","98":"To begin, there is a great opportu- nity to study how a hybrid organization enhances resilience under conditions of high environmental complexity.","99":"To pursue this stream of research, we first need research that more explicitly conceptual- izes and operationalizes the structure and intensity of environmental complexity.","100":"To this end, future research can explore the connections and clashes between logics, the ways broader logics evolve (rapidly and slowly), and the ways organizations facilitate resilience to these changes (Zhao & Wry, 2016).","101":"In addition, facilitating resilience under environ- mental complexity requires that effective mecha- nisms are put in place so organizations can manage potential tensions across stakeholders and resolve conflicts should they arise.","102":"These studies on environmental complexity have mainly focused on the context of so- cial enterprises—a particular type of hybrid organiza- tion that strives to integrate two distinct organizational forms (i.e., business and charity) at its core—and have suggested various hybrid-organizing approaches as effective strategies for facilitating resilience under in- creasingly complex environments (Battilana & Lee, 2014).","103":"Resilience and crisis management research are well positioned to provide important insights for answering these questions.","104":"As Sutcliffe, Vogus, and Dane (2016) described in a recent cross-level review of mindfulness research, qualitative and quantitative studies have linked collective mindfulness to greater organizational re- liability; more effective responses to near disasters, traumas, and actual disasters; and improved clinical outcomes and decreased mortality rates.","105":"More studies that enhance our understanding of the link between crisis management and resilience are likely to make im- portant contributions to organizational science.","106":"Exploring the “Dark Side” of Resilience Research  Our final area of future research is one that was a bit of a surprise from our review, what we have labeled the “dark side” of resilience.","107":"Future research can explore whether and how resilience influences learning from adversity: does sense- making still occur but through other mechanisms (i.e., not triggered by negative emotions)?","108":"Relatedly, future research can more carefully ex- plore the role resilience plays in seeking to mitigate or curtail potential risk behavior after experiencing a near miss.","109":"Future research can explore how resilience to failing influences escalation of commitment courses of action, delayed decisions to terminate poorly performing endeavors, and inability to read- just and change course.","110":"Future research can explore the conditions under which resilience is a liability as opposed to an asset for individuals, teams, and organizations.","111":"Understanding trade-offs between the allocation of resources for building resilience and other activities (innovation, entrepreneurship, etc.)","112":"In summary, research on the dark side of resilience is virtually unexplored, and therefore provides an important and critical opportunity to extend our understanding of the role and influence of resilience in organizational life."},"color":{"r":130,"g":224,"b":170}},"key_insights":{"text":{"0":"We identify unique lines of work on crisis and crisis management: crisis-as-an-event and crisis-as-process.","1":"respond to, and overcome their various forms and degrees to preserve performance, to recover, or to pre- vent decline and even failure (Meyer, 1982; Perrow, 2011; Roux-Dufort, 2007; Sine & David, 2003; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Wan & Yiu, 2009).","2":"Relatedly, although scholars have become increasingly interested in under- standing how and why some organizations are more resilient in the face of severe challenges, research on organizational resilience has largely been explored separately from crisis management; perhaps due to an assumption that resilient actors (i.e., individuals, organizations, and communities) avoid crises.","3":"Integrating research on crisis management (i.e., the ability to return organizations and systems to normal functioning after a disruption) and resil- ience (i.e., the ability to maintain reliable function- ing despite adversity) would seem to be a natural way to more generally strengthen theory of organizational functioning under adversity.","4":"Consequently, we review the crisis management and resilience literatures, highlight various concep- tions and derivations of these concepts as expressed in prior research, and identify key themes and em- pirical findings.","5":"(2011) offer three addi- tional (yet related) components—rarity of the event, significance of the event, and level of impact on stakeholders—as essential to understanding crisis (and its subsequent management).","6":"The focus on surprising and disruptive events gave rise to typologies of crises (e.g., incidents, accidents, conflicts) (Gundel, 2005; Lagadec, 1991; Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992) and related crisis management tech- niques to effectively respond to the event (e.g., Drabek, 1999; Rosenthal, Boin, & Comfort, 2001).","7":"From this crisis-as-event perspective one cannot completely plan for a crisis event given an inability to consider probabilities of potential risks as these events are inconceivable, unscheduled, and un- expected (Rosenthal, 2003; Topper & Lagadec, 2013).","8":"The process perspective suggests that there is a “genealogy of crises that may be po- tentially tracked long before the acute phase .","9":"These occurrences could in- clude system anomalies, organizational weakening, vulnerabilities, and everyday challenges that are unnoticed, ignored, misunderstood, or discounted (Cobb, Wry, & Zhao, 2016; Rudolph & Repenning, 2002; Turner, 1976).","10":"A crisis-as-process perspective broadens the po- tential for research to investigate the “enigmatic or- igin of the event and the possible post-event futures .","11":"In a related study,  Roux-Dufort (2009) found that an accumulation of organizational imperfections combined with mana- gerial ignorance of those imperfections developed into organizational weakening over time, laying a foundation for a triggering crisis event to occur.","12":"In summary, the crisis as process approach high- lights the importance of preevent, in-event, and postevent crisis management.","13":"Specifically, a trigger- ing event can arise from everyday unexpected oc- currences that remain unnoticed, “incubate,” and accumulate into a pending crisis due to among other factors (1) erroneous assumptions, (2) information complexity, (3) a cultural lag in noticing and inter- preting signals, and (4) a reluctance to imagine the worst possible outcome (Turner, 1976: 393–394).","14":"A process-centered perspective suggests that organi- zations may address (i.e., eliminate) the threat of crises before, during, and after the triggering event.","15":"With this as a context, we observed three primary themes: (1) crisis management as a norma- tive and staged activity to restore equilibrium, (2) the role of leaders in crisis management, and (3) the importance of crisis management teams (CMTs).","16":"c Definition: Managing attention to “weak signals” of crises-in process, in-event organizing, and postevent actions to protect a system and (when necessary) bring it back into alignment (Ansoff, 1975; Roux-Dufort & Laloonde, 2013; Portal & Roux-Dufort, 2013)  s There are likely systematic patterns that influence various stages of the crisis process (Deschamps et al., 1997); studying the system could help capture the complexity and ambiguity surrounding crises (Kovoor-Misra, 1995)  s Explain and integrate the many relations linking diverse stakeholders and issues and how these influenced the crisis process (Perrow, 2011; Shrivastava, 1995).","17":"Thus, research in this stream has sought to develop emergency- management policies and procedures (Comfort, 2007; Iannella & Henricksen, 2007) that identify co- ordination, communication, and other activities that enable a more effective disaster response (Comfort & Kapucu, 2006; Marcum, Bevc, & Butts, 2012), such as “clearly defined objectives, a division of labor, a for- mal structure, and a set of policies and procedures” (Schneider, 1992: 138; see also Quarantelli, 2005).","18":"Failure to attend to and incorporate these forms of organizing in crisis management planning and in- tegrate them into broader response efforts can lead to organizational conflict, failure to complete objectives, inefficiency, and (potentially) additional suffering among crisis victims (Marcum et al., 2012; Mendonca, Beroggi, & Wallace, 2001; Webb, 2004).","19":"However, the effectiveness of leadership styles at least partly depends on the nature (and stage) of the crisis, what led to the crisis (e.g.","20":"natural disaster, industrial accident, gradual weakening) and how leadership style interacts with how leaders and organizations prepared for the possibility of an organizational crisis (Bundy & Pfarrer, 2015).","21":"Preparation for different crisis scenarios can influence how leaders react to the crisis, which in turn affects crisis response outcomes.","22":"For example, when the organization is at fault (i.e., industrial acci- dent), acceptance of responsibility and the prior re- lationship a leader had with the organization likely shapes a leader’s social approval, how organizational stakeholders perceive the crisis, and the organiza- tion’s response (Coombs & Holladay, 2001).","23":"Leaders also engage in meaning making to help other stake- holders make sense of information during the throes of a crisis (Christianson et al., 2009), providing sta- bility despite the potential for chaos (Schneider,  1992).","24":"Given the inherent limitations of the command-and-control approach to disaster response (Drabek, 2005; Dynes, 1994; Neal & Phillips, 1995), emergent leadership behaviors and the development of new norms (Schneider, 1992) are critical for addressing organizational and community demands in the crisis aftermath (Auf der Heide, 1989; Stallings & Quarantelli, 1985; Wenger, 1992).","25":"Furthermore, organizational and community leaders must be aware that emergent groups are likely to arise in response to crisis (Drabek & McEntire, 2003).","26":"Therefore, effective leaders must harness the contributions of emergent groups while also minimizing the potential problems associated with such groups.","27":"The actions leaders take before a crisis can be influential in enabling them to successfully navigate their organization through a crisis (James & Wooten, 2010).","28":"For example, certain actions (e.g., deeply engaging in their contexts and directing their behaviors toward proactively searching for and making sense of potential trouble spots) have been shown to enhance performance under trying conditions (Barton, Sutcliffe, Vogus, & DeWitt, 2015).","29":"These studies underscore the importance of ongoing actions by leaders that are heightened  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  739  when organizations rely on those same leaders during the climax (i.e., triggering event) of a cri- sis.","30":"), and then organize action to bring those signals to the collective view can potentially address the ad- versity before it becomes a triggering event (Rerup, 2009).","31":"Re- search on CMTs has generally tried to explain how actors can minimize the impact of and then recover from the disruption of a crisis to return to (or exceed) pre-event functioning.","32":"Critical to adjusting to the rapidly changing work de- mands triggered by a crisis event are building a trusting CMT (Colquitt et al., 2011), balancing a bureaucratic team structure with flexibility (Bigley & Roberts, 2001), and establishing role development and flexibility (Bechky & Okhuysen, 2011).","33":"For example, CMTs can rapidly and flexibly reorganize resources to both reduce stressors to the system and (potentially) generate novel solutions that address changing conditions (Barton & Sutcliffe, 2009; Weick & Roberts, 1993).","34":"(2013) argued that successful “relational systems” within organizations can facilitate crisis sensemaking such that teams and organizations end up better off  after the event than before it (consistent with Brockner & James, 2008; James et al., 2011).","35":"This “better off post-crisis” outcome is consistent with the notion of posttraumatic growth, which describes how positive psychological changes occur “as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circum- stances” (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004: 1; see also Hobfoll, Hall, Canetti-Nisim, Galea, Johnson, & Palmieri, 2007).","36":"Therefore, despite the potential threats posed by ad- versity, highly capable teams and other relational sys- tems embedded in organizations can generate positive outcomes and facilitate a return to (or improvement upon) the status quo (e.g., James, et al., 2011; Kahn et al., 2013; Maitlis & Sonenshein, 2010).","37":"It is this tension around whether adversity can be successfully nav- igated by the organization via leaders or teams that presents an opportunity to better explain not only how organizations respond to challenges but also how an organization disarms challenges before they progress and trigger a crisis event.","38":"Al- though teams hold potential to benefit sensemaking, teams that are reactive and are established as crisis management groups can be prone to failing to make sense of the crisis and identify root causes, which can limit recovery and paralyze attempts to understand what has transpired (Roux-Dufort & Vidaillet, 2003).","39":"We define crisis as a process of weakening or degeneration that can to the actor’s culminate in a disruption event (i.e., individual, organization, and/or community) normal functioning.","40":"And thus we define “crisis  \f740  Academy of Management Annals  June  management” as the actor’s attempt to bring a dis- rupted or weakened system at any stage of crisis back into alignment to achieve normal functioning.","41":"Indeed, re- search examining predictable surprises (Bazerman & Watkins, 2004) and the ways organizations antici- pate and contain everyday unexpected occurrences (e.g., Weick et al., 1999) has grown.","42":"(2010) propose that this state of affairs may be due to the fact that researchers have spent most of their energy exploring the causes, dy- namics, and aftermath of crises rather than trying to understand how organizations can resist adversity or proactively deal with uncertainty and change.","43":"Yet, as crisis researchers have shown repeatedly, the quality of an organization’s response to crisis “critically depends on the capacity to enhance improvisation, coordination, flexibility, and endurance—qualities that we typically associate with resilience” (Boin et al., 2010: 11).","44":"Definitions of Resilience  Resilience generally has been used to describe organizations, systems, or individuals that are able to react to and recover from duress or disturbances with minimal effects on stability and functioning (Linnenluecke, 2015; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003).","45":"At the organizational level, Meyer (1982: 520) used the term resiliency to refer to an organization’s ability (embodied in the existence of resources, ideologies, routines, and structures) to absorb a discrete envi- ronmental jolt and restore prior order.","46":"provide certain features that enhance organizational and in- dividual capacities to “mount collective responses to challenges.” That is, certain features of a system (culture, social connections, etc.)","47":"(2006: 731) define psychological resilience as a “relatively stable personality trait characterized by the ability to overcome, steer through, and bounce back” from daily adversity and challenge.","48":"When applied to the workplace, resil- ience has been defined as a developable “positive psychological capacity to rebound, to ‘bounce back’ from adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure or even positive change, progress, and increased re- sponsibility” (Luthans Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005: 2002).","49":"For ex- ample, organizational resilience is likely not just an “additive composite of individual” resilience (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011: 245), but rather includes the interaction between an organization, its stake- holders, and the environment while confronted with adversity.","50":"In addition, perspectives on resilience include positively adjusting in the face of adversity (Weick et al., 1999), bouncing back from setbacks or challenges (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), coping to absorb strain (Bunderson & Sutcliffe, 2002; Edmondson, 1999), and adapting through “processes that help organizations retain resources in a form suffi- ciently flexible, storable, and malleable to avert maladaptive tendencies” in dealing with the un- expected (Gittell et al., 2006: 303; Walker et al., 2004).","51":"At the organization level, the issue is not so much whether an organization’s capacity is fixed (e.g., trait-like) or malleable—most scholars agree that organizational resilience develops over time (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005; Wildavsky, 1988); rather it is whether resilience is an outcome or a process.","52":"(2011) propose, some see organizational resilience as a return to the status quo (where the organization left off), whereas others see resilience as an exploitation of current challenges to emerge stronger and more resourceful.","53":"Research on employee and occupational resilience seems to suggest that resil- ience is more ordinary (e.g., Gittell et al., 2006; Lengnick-Hall and Beck, 2005, 2009); something re- quired to deal with a variety of stressors, conflicts, and disturbances that occur over one’s occupational or professional career.","54":"The idea that resilience is more ordinary and required more broadly shows up in the organizational literature as well.","55":"If we think of resilience as an outcome, and couple it with the crisis-as-event perspective, resilience nat- urally would be situated after the event.","56":"Building on previous definitions and taking these issues into account we take a middle ground ap- proach and define “resilience” as the process by which an actor (i.e., individual, organization, or community) builds and uses its capability endow- ments to interact with the environment in a way that positively adjusts and maintains functioning prior to, during, and following adversity.","57":"As such, it is inclusive of preadversity capabilities, in-crisis organizing and adjusting, and postcrisis resilience responding.","58":"Emphasis is on maintenance (not loss and recovery) of functioning throughout a crisis; one of several trajectories individuals experience in response to threat (Bonanno & Mancini, 2012) that is shaped by temporal and sociocontextual characteristics of stress and adaptation (Luthar et al., 2000)  s “The persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain  the same relationships between populations or state variables” (Holling, 1973: 7)  c “Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so  as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape” (Walker, Holling, Carpenter, & Kinzig, 2004)  adaptation (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005;

Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993; Weick, 1995).","63":"The difference between “triumph and tragedy” hinges on an organization’s ability to make sense of the dynamic contexts in which it is embed- ded (Boin et al., 2005; Weick, 1995).","64":"In his article exploring variance in the design struc- tures of two companies operating high-risk nuclear power plants, Carroll (1998) found that organizations with fragmentary and myopic understandings of work tasks (rooted in organizational design) are more likely to experience recurrent problems and disruptions; that is, they are less resilient.","65":"Combining capabilities and structural aspects of the firm, Lai, Saridakis, Blackburn, and Johnstone (2016) found that, depending on firm size, human resource management practices (i.e., team structure, management formality, decisions to layoff or re- deploy employees) during an economic downturn influenced organizational resilience.","66":"Specifically, smaller firms were more creative than large firms, and these creative actions helped maintain positive functioning despite the economic downturn, further demonstrating how organizations can leverage vari- ous endowments (e.g., employees, managerial skills) associated with organizational design for resilience.","67":"Behavioral capabilities also involve establishing comfort with uncertainty, decision-making diffusion across units (to allow for interpretation and action on relevant information), and practiced behaviors of cooperation and coordination (Boin & Lagadec, 2000).","68":"These behavioral capabilities are perhaps best demonstrated by high-reliability organizations (Bigley & Roberts, 2001; Weick et al., 1999) as well as the emergence of new organizations that take action during times of crisis (Drabek & McEntire, 2003; Majcherzak et al., 2007; Shepherd & Williams, 2014).","69":"Emotion- regulation capabilities refer to a mental fortitude that provides actors with mental hardiness and self- regulation to cope with adverse situations, and produces positive work-related outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, performance) (Avey, Luthans, & Jensen, 2009; Luthans et al., 2005).","70":"Similarly, organiza- tions differ in how they utilize and regulate emotions, which can shape important organizational out- comes including responses to adversity (Parke & Seo, 2016).","71":"For example, emotional capabilities facilitate employees’ commitment to change initia- tives despite the challenges and potential disrup- tions such initiatives could cause (Shin et al., 2012), and they provide individuals with the psychologi- cal resources needed to persist in risky endeavors with lower levels of stress (Baron et al., 2016).","72":"Finally, the capability to regulate emotions is closely related to emotional ambivalence or the “si- multaneous experience of contradictory feelings” (Vogus, Rothman, Sutcliffe, & Weick, 2014: 593).","73":"Moreover, emotional ambivalence likely impacts relational interactions, which in turn shapes the social dynamics of teams and organiza- tions (Rothman & Wiesenfeld, 2007).1  Relational capability endowments.","74":"Furthermore, relational capabilities provide a context in which cognitive, behavioral, and emotional capabilities can be activated.","75":"For example, relationships—in the form of coordinative practices—have been found to be critical in overcoming challenges (Gittell, 2008).","76":"Further, they found that in a vola- tile environment, trust was paramount to achieving positive outcomes, whereas trust was less important in less volatile environments.","77":"This finding suggests that organizations that do not anticipate facing adverse conditions may fail to de- velop elemental capabilities (i.e., trust) that will be needed to function as a group or team.","78":"When the disaster hit, those who had local values, knowledge, and network relationships were better positioned to gain the trust of disaster victims, which enabled a more immediate and effective response to the widespread suffering.","79":"746  Academy of Management Annals  June  action in the aftermath of the bushfire disaster, sug- gesting that various forms of human capital shape actions, which in turn influence resilience.","80":"This finding high- lights the notion that the mere possession of a resource does not necessarily confer an advantage; resources need to be used, or else they may be detrimental to functioning (Hobfoll, 1989, 1991).","81":"Although some crises can be seen as more “normal” emergencies (e.g., fires, traffic accidents, hostage tak- ings) (Patriotta & Gruber, 2015; Perrow, 2011) other crises that potentially threaten people and organiza- tions result from high-impact, fast-onset triggering events, such as natural disasters, economic downturns, the emergence of new technologies, and political in- stability (Zhou, Wan, & Jia, 2010).","82":"Resilience to these phenomena is important given that such events are “collectively experienced, [have] an acute onset, and [are] time delineated,” thus, swift decision-making in highly ambiguous contexts is vital to avoid additional suffering (McFarlane & Norris, 2006: 4).","83":"Fast-onset crises can cut across all social strata and often prove to be highly disruptive (Bonanno et al., 2010) to in- dividuals and organizations.","84":"Given the nature and impact of these crises, a considerable body of research (primarily in sociology) has explored how organiza- tions can anticipate, respond, and decrease vulnera- bility, particularly while drawing on government and nongovernment organizations as resource providers (for a review, see Drabek & McEntire, 2003).","85":"When organi- zations face these scenarios quick action is required to alert decision makers to unfolding conditions to keep operations within a bandwidth of accept- able performance (Schulman, Roe, van Eeten, & de Bruijne, 2004) or to actively develop contingent re- sponses (Weick et al., 1999).","86":"For example, resilience in a pediatric intensive care unit involved repeated iterations of team structuring and design and continuous efforts to buffer the unit from the parent organization’s pressures (Madsen et al., 2006).","87":"The most effective responses appear to be those that involve “innovative, continually changeable behavior” (Stacey, 1995: 478), “improvising lo- cally” (Shepherd & Williams, 2014: 977), and the “capacity for spontaneous changeability” (Stacey, 1995: 478).","88":"Taking stock of the various forms of re- sponses to major disturbances, it is useful to high- light specific mechanisms organizational members and/or organizations use to maintain pos- itive functioning under this adversity (Bunderson & Sutcliffe, 2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003).","89":"Maintain- ing positive functioning in the aftermath of a disaster or some other major disturbance depends on the or- ganization’s cognitive and behavioral responses, which are in turn reinforced by context.","90":"Positive cognitive responses that help maintain positive functioning in the face of major disturbances involve an actor’s ability to notice, interpret, and analyze changes in the envi- ronment and to formulate responses (Dewald & Bowen, 2010) that go beyond “simply surviving the  ordeal” (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005: 750).","91":"For ex- ample, in contrast to decision makers who perceive innovative business-model introductions as threats and thus resist adopting changes to strategy, de- cision makers who perceive these innovations as opportunities are more likely to adopt aspects of these innovations into their core practices, enabling to a changed competitive landscape adjustment (Dewald & Bowen, 2010).","92":"Similarly, cognitive re- sponses that facilitate adjustment to adversity assist decision makers in directing attention appropriately, allowing them to focus on the best action options available to reduce complexity and generate viable alternatives for a path forward (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005).","93":"Specifically, to the extent that decision makers are better able to understand the content and duration of a major disturbance; the ways that disturbance- induced change influence the broader environment; and the structural, routine, or other (if any) organiza- tional changes needed, the more likely they are to maintain positive functioning in the new environ- ment (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005).","94":"When facing ex- treme adversity, flexible decision-making processes are essential as rigid decision-making processes can compound losses, thus resulting in even more dis- ruptive outcomes for individuals and firms (Bonanno et al., 2010; Hobfoll, 2011; Rahmandad & Repenning, 2016).","95":"When facing a major disturbance, individuals must draw upon immediately available resources and make time-sensitive decisions between “staying the course” and deviating from planned routines.","96":"Another example of cognitive responses to a major disturbance is how passengers and crew members aboard a hijacked airplane (Flight 93 on September 11th) organized courageous collective action to compel the hijackers to crash the plane into the ground rather than into a national landmark.","97":"These findings demonstrate the influence of time, surprise, new frame develop- ment, and resource mobilization on the development and deployment of group cognitive processes and demonstrate the wide range of “organizing” that shapes resilience processes.","98":"Specifically, positive behavioral responding to an adverse event is “the engine that moves” an actor forward in the face of uncertainty (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005: 751) and includes balancing varied action repertoires with structured “functional habits” (e.g., rehearsed rou- tines for managing uncertainty) (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003: 107).","99":"For example, an innovative response (presumably one that is more adaptive) to organizational decline is more likely when the firm operates in a less in- stitutionalized environment, concentrates power (rather than diffusing power in the organizational structure), and accesses many uncommitted re- sources (Mone, McKinley, & Barker, 1998).","100":"Addi- tional research highlights the importance of aligning specific tactics (i.e., behaviors) with overarching strategies when developing a behavioral response to adversity.","101":"For example, when applying the resilience of the Republic of Rome to modern-day organizations, Carmeli and Markman (2011) theorized that resilient firms carefully balance their strategic emphasis on growth and development (i.e., capture) with efficiency and self-management (i.e., governance).","102":"Within the  context of these strategies, firms also need to balance their strategy with specific tactics-saving power, maintaining a stronghold base, isolating adversaries, and creating forward outposts (Carmeli & Markman, 2011).","103":"Beyond broad strategic actions and tactics involved in resilience, specific organizational activities can facilitate adjustment to substantial disturbances.","104":"For example, in war-torn Afghanistan, some individuals still identify and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities (Bullough et al., 2013); in the aftermath of an earthquake in Haiti (Williams & Shepherd, 2016a) and a bushfire in Australia (Shepherd & Williams, 2014; Williams & Shepherd, 2016b), victims mobilized resources and created new ventures to alleviate others’ suffering; and in the wake of the Great Recession, entrepre- neurs used their ventures as vehicles to repurpose their identity, which in turn influenced day-to-day behaviors that ultimately shaped the firms’ strategic response to the adversity (Powell & Baker, 2014).","105":"It appears that resilience involves (at least in part) transitioning from a dependence on slack resources to self-reliance based on resourceful emergent ac- tions that enable actors to enact “who they want to be”—that is, to activate new roles and identities (Powell & Baker, 2014; Williams & Shepherd, 2016a, 2016b).","106":"At the organizational level, different types of organizations are likely to experience adver- sity differently and thus have distinct perceptions of its potential costs.","107":"Community so- cial networks among neighbors and proximate or- ganizations provide access to various resources in adverse situations, such as information, loans and gifts for property repair, shelter, and emotional and psychological support (Aldrich & Meyer, 2014; Shepherd & Williams, 2014).","108":"Different types of so- cial capital may serve complementary functions in helping individuals endure and recover from ad- versity.","109":"Bonding social capital—namely, strong, densely connected ties—translates into greater levels of trust and more widely shared norms within the community (Coleman, 1990), which fosters resilience.","110":"Resilience Feedback Loop  As organizational members and organizations take action in response to adversity, they may gain new  insights and perspectives that feed into resource endowments, ongoing organizing, adaptation, prep- aration, and response to adversity.","111":"The interaction between the environment and actors is an inherently dynamic process (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005) such that interpretations evolve over time and are resha- ped depending on the nature of the adversity and the behavior of the actor.","112":"Enhancing resilience from feedback has largely been explored in terms of actors’ experiences and interpretations.","113":"For example, organizations oscillate between periods of empha- sizing safety and periods of emphasizing other goals, such as efficiency or innovation (Haunschild, Polidoro, & Chandler, 2015).","114":"As a consequence, the ability to learn from an experience with adversity weakens over time, increasing an organization’s vulnerability.","115":"Moreover, firms are more vulnerable to adversity when their managers seek feedback from those in their network who have similar experiences (i.e., like-minded advisors from close network ties) because this feedback can lead to misinterpreting signals about the adverse environment contributing to an organizational crisis (McDonald & Westphal, 2003).","116":"Ex- posure to adversity also influences how decision makers interpret future challenges and disruptions, identify appropriate tasks, and activate relationships to address issues.","117":"Similarly, some novel scenarios appear so extraordinary that actors cannot accommodate them into existing worldviews (Cerulo, 2008), resulting in relatively little learning or response.","118":"What is important to realize is that the ability of human systems to interpret and accom- modate surprising feedback is “contextually and temporally dependent” (Rudolph & Repenning, 2002: 3).","119":"Furthermore, our review highlighted different uses of resilience in the literature, includ- ing an emphasis on building collective capacities, knowledge, skills, and abilities for resilience, as well as resource endowments, organizing practices, and postcrisis response.","120":"We offer this model as a framing for how future research might integrate important aspects of both crisis and resil- ience in explaining the mechanisms through which organizations anticipate, prepare for, and respond to adversity.","121":"As portrayed in Figure 1, organizations that de- velop cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and re- lational capabilities can realign in response to drift as well as facilitate the anticipation of and responses to  triggering events.","122":"These capabilities in turn interact recursively with organizing efforts related to reli- ability and risk reduction.","123":"Alternatively, a surprising event could occur that did not result from weakening that threatens functioning.","124":"When these events occur, organizations respond (cogni- tively and behaviorally) as an interaction with the triggering event.","125":"After experiencing and overcoming a major crisis, there is a feedback loop in which ac- tors’ interpretations of the tasks and relationships they experienced during adversity shape organizing for subsequent adversity.","126":"These themes are (1) leadership in the face of adversity, (2) the role of time in adversity, (3) complexity and adversity, (4) mindfulness and adversity, and (5) the dark side of resilience.","127":"More recently, research has begun to articulate the microprocesses that fuel resilience before crises oc- cur, emphasizing leadership behaviors that enable quicker recognition and resolution of potential dis- ruptions.","128":"(2015) made the case for contextualized engagement: when leaders proac- tively engage with those on the front lines who face difficult situations, actively searching for discrep- ancies and unexpected problems and making sense of them, rather than avoiding or merely coping with the adversity.","129":"This provides insight into how organizing processes help to forestall or mitigate crises as they unfold and is consistent with literature on the importance of active sensemaking (Gephart, 1993, 2007, Weick, 1995) and the avoidance of normalizing (Vaughan, 1996; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006).","130":"Sensemaking is crit- ical for noticing disruptions and understanding their significance (Weick, Sutcliffe, Obstfeld, 2005).","131":"As Wildavsky high- lighted (1988), for organizations to accommodate the reality of organizational uncertainty, they must en- gage in deliberate efforts to become better at coping with surprise not only by gaining strength from stress but also by “expanding general knowledge and technical facility, and generalized command over resources” (p. 221).","132":"Future research can make a substantial contribu- tion to the literature by exploring the role of leader- ship in preparing for, adjusting to, and responding to adversity as well as building endowments in a way that promotes greater resilience, thereby avoiding a triggering event and the need for crisis manage- ment.","133":"However, there is less research on how leaders build endow- ments (in the organization and/or themselves), es- pecially endowments that promote resilience.","134":"Can leaders encour- age a better understanding of how their organizations interpret and interact with the environment to pro- mote greater resilience?","135":"For example, in addition to the contextualized engagement noted earlier (Barton et al., 2015), what leadership behav- iors are necessary to develop “extraordinary levels of vigilance” to avoid crisis events (e.g., leadership behaviors that promote reliability and risk manage- ment to reduce organizational vulnerability), and how do these behaviors differ from more ordinary leadership behaviors?","136":"It could be that while we normally think of leaders as promotion focused (emphasizing opportunities; potential rewards in terms of gains and nongains), preparing for adversity may require leaders with more of a prevention focus (emphasizing threats; potential rewards in terms of nonlosses) (see Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 1999).","137":"Third, when responding to adversity,  leaders likely need to possess the cognitive and behavioral attributes that facilitate resilience.","138":"Although in- dividuals possess unique traits that influence their responses to adversity in different ways (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2010), we need a greater un- derstanding of how leaders are able to “bring out” these attributes in organizational members (in- dividually and as a collective) so as to facilitate resilience.","139":"What leadership behaviors before, dur- ing, and immediately after key challenges trigger the sort of resourcefulness and responsiveness neces- sary for resilience?","140":"Finally, although most leaders and other organiza- tional members understand the importance of learning from mistakes, surprising events, and crises (Deverell & Hans´en, 2009; Madsen, & Desai, 2010; McGrath, 1999), most people and organizations find this difficult to accomplish (Baumard & Starbuck, 2005; Cannon & Edmondson, 2001, 2005; Edmondson, 2004).","141":"Therefore, future research will hopefully investigate how leaders facilitate crisis sensemaking and learning while avoiding “overcorrecting” or en- couraging rumination or other nonproductive cogni- tions and behaviors (Carmeli, Brueller, & Dutton, 2009; Carmeli & Gittell, 2009) that could undermine resilience to subsequent adversity.","142":"An answer could lie with the organization’s psychological safety (Baer & Frese, 2003; Edmondson, 1999), emotional capability (Huy, 1999; Shepherd, Patzelt, & Wolfe, 2011), and/or attention structures (Ocasio, 1997); this is fertile ground for future research.","143":"For example, Barton and Sutcliffe (2009) showed how organizations use a variety of practices to overcome dysfunctional momentum—the escalation of negative outcomes.","144":"Specifically, we anticipate a number of op- portunities for future research to explore the role of time in the stages an organization goes through when expe- riencing adversity in public forums.","145":"First, adversity is heterogeneous; some challenges are triggered quickly, evolve rapidly, and are short in duration, whereas other challenges emerge slowly, evolve more gradually, and are extended over time.","146":"However, this time dimension is likely to differ for actors based on their endowments, preparation, and  response.","147":"For example, when preparing for adver- sity, an organization may quickly detect sources of adversity and rapidly respond such that any dis- ruption to positive functioning is minor and short in duration.","148":"Given the frequency of unexpected events and importance of deadlines in their environment, news organiza- tions are more accustomed to dealing with and responding to intense situations quickly and fluidly than a typical organization.","149":"These recent studies underscore the importance of considering both everyday unexpected occurrences and less-frequent major events to gain an understand- ing of which become crises and which are detected and mitigated before they become crises.","150":"As losses are more salient, it is critical that those experiencing adversity identify pathways to generate new and immediate resource gains (Hobfoll, 2011).","151":"These endowments could include potential resources like community embeddedness, social networks (including both structure and content), and broader context or institutional factors.","152":"Does the passage of time help organizations (i.e., organizational members collec- tively) interpret their experiences with adversity in a way that builds endowments or otherwise helps them to be better prepared for subsequent adversity?","153":"If we can gain a deeper understanding of what hap- pens during this period of learning, then perhaps learning can be accelerated or otherwise enhanced.","154":"Although organizations have always faced ex- ternal threats (Thompson, 1967), contemporary or- ganizations are embedded in a web of interconnected  stakeholders.","155":"Different stakeholders are likely to have varying interests and objectives (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) and may thus impose conflicting and compet- ing demands on organizations, pulling them onto di- vergent paths.","156":"Some bodies of literature such as work on HROs (Roberts, 1990; Weick et al., 1999) provide some in- sight and more recent empirical studies are in- vestigating the micromechanisms (e.g., Barton et al., 2015).","157":"Still, how do more ordinary organizations design resilient systems to be better prepared for unexpected challenges?","158":"We anticipate that contributions can be made to control theory by addressing how organizations recognize potential disruptions, prepare for those challenges, and over- come surprises in an effective way.","159":"Such dif- ferences and changes in perspectives and opinions across stakeholders may lead to confusion about the organization’s identity and may make strategic decision-making, such as how to allocate internal re- sources, more difficult.","160":"Attending to the complexity of organizational life and the ways actors manage these competing demands on a day-to-day basis thus has important implications for understanding organiza- tional resilience in preparation for unexpected events in increasingly complex environments (Zhao, Fisher, Lounsbury, & Miller, 2017).","161":"The increasing prevalence and prom- inence of hybrid organizations provides an ideal setting for such integration.","162":"Hybrid organizations combine multiple organizational forms and embed multiple missions/values not just in their mission statements but also in their everyday practices (Battilana, Lee, Walker, & Dorsey, 2012).","163":"Because of their simultaneous pursuit of different and often- times competing missions, these organizations tend to experience divergent pressures from different stakeholders and face unique challenges in manag- ing the associated complexity (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Pache & Santos, 2013; Zhao & Lounsbury, 2016).","164":"Despite the increasing scholarly attention to hy- brid organizations and the environmental complex- ity they face as well as the practical importance of resilience for hybrid organizations, the literatures on environmental complexity, hybrids, and resilience have largely been developed independent of each other.","165":"Recent research on envi- ronmental complexity has uncovered various mechanisms organizations employ when managing competing pressures and navigating different stake- holder demands.","166":"These hybrid-organizing strategies have been shown to be effective for managing the internal and external tensions caused by environmental complex- ity (see Battilana & Lee, 2014 for a summary), which enrich our understanding of the mechanisms under- lying resilience—mechanisms that mitigate potential tensions in day-to-day activities and avoid the escala- tion of these tensions into major crises.","167":"Conversely, the resilience and crisis management literatures can also help formulate a more complete theory of hybrid organizing in social enterprises; hybrid organizing is not simply reactive to a chang- ing environment but entails a full range of organiz- ing processes that are both proactive and reactive, such as understanding the initial conditions (i.e., organizational endowment), preparing for/preventing adversity, and responding to triggering events.","168":"For instance, how effective are initial resource en- dowments (e.g., financial slack) in mitigating the competing pressures social enterprises face?","169":"Are pluralist leaders with paradoxical thinking better positioned to navigate complex demands, make more optimal resource-allocation decisions, and mitigate the risks of internal conflicts?","170":"What are the best reso- lution mechanisms when potential tensions across stakeholders escalate into major disruptions (e.g., the Andhra Pradesh microfinance crisis in India and the No Pago movement in Nicaragua)?","171":"Thus, all organizations can benefit from actively facilitating resilience before facing adversity even though neither the costs of ad- versity nor the price of being alert to surprises can re- ally be determined in advance (Almklov & Antonsen, 2010).","172":"Some industries and organizational contexts, such as wildland firefighting, health care, and other hazardous industries (e.g., commercial aviation, nu- clear power, and chemical processing) have no choice but to work constantly on their resilience (e.g., Vogus et al., 2014).","173":"(2015) explained, these organizations must perform reliably despite uncer- tainty, thus underscoring the need to actively work to become alert and aware of emerging threats as they unfold.","174":"This collective capability to discern discrimi- natory detail about emerging issues and to act swiftly in response to these details (Weick et al., 1999; Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2012)—known as collective (i.e., organiza- tional) mindfulness—is another mechanism common to both crisis management and resilience.","175":"Perhaps, the most important question to be answered relates to the goals of collective mindfulness and the ultimate outcomes thereof.","176":"If higher reliability is produced through processes of mindful organizing, we should expect that organizations (or their sub- units) that organize for mindfulness will experience fewer crises and be more resilient over the long term than their not-so-organized counterparts.","177":"(1999) proposed that organizational mindfulness is not about single individuals being mindful or engaging in meditative practices, al- though the veracity of that claim is unsettled.","178":"The integration of crisis management and resilience po- sitions us to better understand various relationships, such as the associations between individual and or- ganizational resilience and individual and collective mindfulness as well as their cross-level associations.","179":"Given that mindfulness has been found to facilitate self-regulation and reduce automatic mental pro- cesses (Glomb, Duffy, Bono, & Yang, 2011), does in- dividual mindfulness enable attentional stability, breadth, and vividness (see Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006), which might help employees notice and/or respond to emerging threats more quickly?","180":"For example, those who are more resilient typically possess (overly) posi- tive self-conceptions [e.g., “self-enhancing biases” (Westphal & Bonanno 2007: 422)], which can “give rise to ‘positive illusions’ that enable people to be energetic and happy .","181":"We anticipate that important contributions will be made by future research that explores the potential downsides of resilience and the ways these down- sides might accelerate or exacerbate a triggering event.","182":"Al- though disruptive, these negative emotions can motivate reflection on and sensemaking of causes leading up to the disruption and can ultimately generate high levels of learning (for review, see Shepherd, Williams, Patzelt & Wolfe, 2016; Ucbasaran et al., 2013).","183":"If resilient individuals are “immune” to these sensemaking triggers in the face of challenges, they may fail to attend to and act on signals in- dicating the need to make changes to improve indi- vidual, group, or venture performance.","184":"It then becomes important to explore the cognitive and decision-making mechanisms (e.g., regulatory focus, attribution, framing) that obstruct the actor from reflecting on and learning from experiences with adversity (assuming that learning helps in pre- paring for and responding to subsequent adversity).","185":"A series of experiments by Tinsley, Dillon, and Cronin (2012) showed that when people escape disaster and frame their experience in terms of resilience (i.e., as a close call), they underestimate the danger of future similar situations and are less likely to take actions to mitigate potential risks.","186":"In other words, framing an event in a resilient way leads to more risky behaviors in the future which lead to even more devastating consequences.","187":"Although noble in many cases, there are situations in which persistence may be ill chosen, such as escalation of commitment to a losing course of action (Brockner, 1992; Ross & Staw, 1993) or the inability to overcome dysfunctional momentum to adjust actions (Barton & Sutcliffe, 2009).","188":"Therefore, somewhat ironically, resilience to adversity may— under some conditions—create the basis for a sub- sequent major disruption.","189":"Third, while “uniquely adaptive following expo- sure to” adversity, resilience tends to “be associated with at least some maladaptive characteristics in normal circumstances” (Westphal & Bonanno, 2007: 422).","190":"For example, individuals higher in resilience sometimes tend to be narcissistic and self-enhancing, evoking negative impressions in others (John & Robins, 1994) and creating a potential liability.","191":"Al- though these behaviors provide coping advantages during adversity, they can result in social liabilities (Bonanno, Keltner, Holen, & Horowitz, 1995; Bonanno, Rennicke, & Dekel, 2005).","192":"This type of coping is described as pragmatic or ugly coping and can include emotional disassociation (i.e., emotional numbing), which offers an escape from the negative consequences of adversity but is associated with long- term health costs (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno & Singer, 1990).","193":"Individuals and organizations vary in how much attention they dedicate to adversity depending on roles (individual level), organizational objectives, and institutional environments.","194":"These attentional differences influence preparation, decision-making, and resource allocation for everyday occurrences and major disruptions (Bigley & Roberts, 2001; Perrow, 2011).","195":"Although resilience clearly plays a positive role in organizing in the face of  \f758  Academy of Management Annals  June  adversity, there are likely “downsides” to resilience in certain scenarios, which to date are virtually unexplored.","196":"Resilience points to the means of counteracting weakening or strategic misalignment as well as responding and adjusting to triggering events."},"color":{"r":133,"g":193,"b":233}},"key_findings":{"text":{"0":"Contents may not be copied, emailed, posted to a listserv, or otherwise transmitted without the copyright holder’s express written permission.","1":"With this body of literature, we systematically reviewed articles and inductively coded them into categories.","2":"Finally, Shrivastava (1995) argued that crises are not events but processes ex- tended in time and space.","3":"That is, the inability to attend to weak signs of danger in a con- sistent way across the organization built up over time until they triggered a crisis event.","4":"make up the “sequences of disaster development, accumulating unnoticed until a precipitating event leads to the onset of the disaster and a degree of .","5":"Following an exceptional event, en- vironmental turbulence ensues due to disrupted structures, routines, and capabilities.","6":"In summary, resilience has been defined and used in a variety of literatures, demonstrating the broad appeal it has across fields and the opportunity to find common ground needed to build theory.","7":"Resilience is generally inferred from a judgment that an entity has survived or thrived in the face of extenuating circumstances that posed a threat to good outcomes (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003).","8":"This involves (1) the ability to absorb strain and preserve (or improve) functioning despite the presence of adversity (both internal adversity—such as rapid change, lousy leadership, performance production pressures—and external adversity—such as increasing competition and demands from stakeholders) or (2) an ability to recover or bounce back from untoward events.","9":"For example, Gittell’s (2008) study of managed care providers suggested that resilience was a consequence of more frequent, timely, and accurate information-sharing and problem-solving activities.","10":"(2003) found that psychologically resilient people were buffered from depression by deliberately drawing on positive emotions (e.g., gratitude and love) in the wake of the attacks.","11":"(2011) found that trust was based on coworker integrity, or the perceived con- sistency between words, deeds, and values with prior experience.","12":"Interest- ingly, although those with entrepreneurial experience were more likely to organize efforts to help others, those with entrepreneurial experience who failed to engage in compassion venturing (i.e., creating a new venture to alleviate others’ suffering) had the lowest levels of postdisaster functioning.","13":"Strategies of preparing and anticipating work best for “risks that can be predicted and are well understood” (de Bruijne, Boin, & van Eeten, 2010: 22).","14":"When ex- posed to a major disturbance, actors face increased uncertainty about what actions to take (Duncan, 1972; Milliken, 1987; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) and thus try to generate a range of possible responses.","15":"For example, in his classic study of the Mann Gulch di- saster, Weick (1993) highlighted breakdowns that occurred in how a firefighting team perceived, interpreted, and acted on surprising environmental conditions.","16":"He found that “mediated communica- tion” imposed unnecessary structure on the small group of firefighters, which limited the “interper- sonal cognitive processes” they needed to create a shared interpretive scheme of the environment.","17":"Without a shared sense of meaning, the team had disjointed “frameworks” for identifying solutions, resulting in a collapse of sensemaking that led to the death of 13 firefighters (Weick, 1993: 645).","18":"In a study of this event, Quinn and Worline (2008) found that individuals engaged in narratives to help them understand and manage the intensity of the immediate situation, explain the duress to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and formulate a sense of a “collective” body of resources that could be mobilized.","19":"In his classic study exploring the Mann Gulch disaster, Weick (1993) found that despite the seemingly tight integration of the “smoke jumping” teams, their social connections were insufficiently deep, leading to mis- communications, inability to rapidly align in interpret- ing the environment, and confusion in the face of novelty (which cost most of them their lives).","20":"Various studies have shown that local social connections regularly serve as first re- sponders in disaster situations well ahead of pro- fessional and formal rescue operations (Kapucu, 2008; Quarantelli & Dynes, 1977).","21":"It seems that individuals’ resilience to adver- sity depends on the similarity of that adversity to difficulties they have experienced in the past [e.g., an individual’s resilience to a disaster is facilitated when he or she has previously experienced a disaster but not so much from other forms of adversity (Bonanno et al., 2010)].","22":"For example, re- peated interruptions of routines and tasks can pre- cipitate a crisis because the constant interruption can  \f750  Academy of Management Annals  June  make it difficult to differentiate noise from “true” signals of change (Rudolph & Repenning, 2002).","23":"For example, the team working on the Challenger space shuttle “missed” the O-ring data because of repeated disruptions that “crowded out” the signal of the true problem at hand (Vaughan, 1996).","24":"Finally, we anticipate that there are both positive and negative outcomes that result from resilience.","25":"Although resilience likely enhances perseverance, functioning, and reliability to challenging events, it may also result in resistance to change, failure to learn and adapt, and or an in- ability to pivot or transform.","26":"Perhaps, as alluded to earlier, the leadership required for responding to adversity is different than that required for building an endow- ment and preparing for it.","27":"That is, when the bank employed double-looped learning they were better prepared to eliminate small problems that could have led to another crisis.","28":"In contrast, when they did not have formal organizational learning protocols they were more likely to experience another crisis.","29":"In his extensive work on responses to stress, Hobfoll (1989, 1991, 2011) argued that resource los- ses are more salient than resource gains given the speed at which loss occurs compared to gains.","30":"Timing is critical as initial gains can trigger “gain spirals” such that initial gains prompt subsequent resource gains that likely facilitate resilience.","31":"That said, a few important opportunities for future research exist that touch on both domains of inquiry.","32":"First, negative emotions can be generated in those that facing adversity, providing a clear signal “something went wrong here” that requires attention and action (McGrath, 1999; Shepherd, 2003).","33":"When people escape a pending disaster, such as avoiding a near collision, they can interpret their experience as one of resilience (i.e., a close call, a disaster that did not occur, a crisis avoided) or one of vulnerability (i.e., a near hit, a disaster that almost occurred, a crisis narrowly averted) (March, Sproull, & Tamuz, 1991)."},"color":{"r":241,"g":148,"b":138}},"definitions":{"text":{"0":"That is, they circumvent major disruption to functioning before, during, and/or after adversity (Alexander, 2013;

Roux-Dufort, 2016)  s Various features (organizational, institutional,  etc.)","3":"In contrast, if leaders remain “willfully ig- norant” and retreat from the reality of accumulating imperfection and vulnerabilities in their organiza- tions, then these imperfections will build up until reaching “a saturation point that takes them out of managers’ control” and results in a major disruption (i.e., triggering event) (Roux-Dufort, 2009: 6).","4":"Over time, resilience has been studied in a number of disciplines including psychology (especially how children overcome adversity) (Bonanno, 2004; Flach, 1988; Masten, 2013; Waller, 2001), the orga- nization sciences (Linnenluecke, 2015; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), engineering (describing the strength and ductility of steel beams) (Rankine, 1867) and more recently in resilience engineering (e.g., Hollnagel, Woods, Leveson, 2006), and ecology (Holling, 1973) (referring to the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to a perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly).","5":"Despite the clear interest across fields of study, some critics claim that because the concept of resilience has been defined, operationalized, and applied differently across multiple levels of analy- sis [e.g., individual (Bonanno, 2004, 2012), organiza- tional (Manyena, 2006; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), and system (Holling, 1973; Walker et al., 2004)], its use- fulness as a scholarly construct has been stymied (Linnenluecke, 2015).","6":"Walker, Holling, Carpenter, and Kinzig (2004: 4) argue that “resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system’s dynamics.” A dynamic per- spective, therefore, would involve an interaction between actors (i.e., organizations, individuals, and institutions) and the environment that allows for “a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks” (Walker et al., 2004: 5).","7":"As Kossek and Perrigino (2016) make clear, occupational (i.e., employee) resilience comprises all three.","8":"An entity does not survive merely because of inner re- sources; rather it survives and thrives on the basis of its ability to adapt and/or dynamically relate to its environment.","9":"But, as Boin, Comfort, and Demchak (2010: 8) ask, what about the severity of that adversity: is resilience a capacity to deal with rare, devastating events, or it is a capacity to deal with a much wider range of disruptions and disturbances that fall outside “of the set of disturbances the system is designed to handle” (Boin et al., 2010: 8)?","10":"In Thomas Blount’s (1656) dictionary, “to rebound,” “to go back on one’s word” c Resiliency (Bell, 1839): fortitude in response to adversity, withstand challenges (i.e., earthquakes) c Adjustment of children in response to adversity (Flach, 1988;

Thompson, 1967)—that facilitate the processing and sharing of information, work tasks, and so forth (March & Simon, 1958; Thompson, 1967; Tushman & Nadler, 1978).","15":"Fur- thermore, individuals and organizations that are more capable of regulating emotions (i.e., knowing how and when to express or suppress emotions in accord with situational demands) experience less distress and demonstrate greater long-term adjust- ment (Bonanno et al., 2004).","16":"For example, studies of high reliability organizations (HROs) (Roberts, 1990)—organizations that manage poten- tially hazardous technical systems (e.g., commer- cial aviation, nuclear power, nuclear submarines) (Roberts, 1990; Roberts, Stout, & Halpern, 1994)— show that they (HROs) expend resources to defend against particular risks, but they also engage in establishing organizing practices to be able to im- provise and “craft what [they] need, when [they] need it, even though [they] previously had no idea [they] would need it” (Wildavsky, 1995: 433).","17":"More specifically, processes of catastrophe-avoidance (e.g., organizing to ensure in- that a system does not weaken or drift) clude carefully allocating and distributing attention, knowledge, and resources across the organization to facilitate the recognition and interpretation of po- tential problems (Marcus & Nichols, 1999); enhanc- ing sensemaking and decision-making processes by engaging in daily practices and routines (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007; Weick et al., 1999); focusing on ac- countability and the salience of signals (Barton et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 1994); and reducing tensions between high-reliability structures and the broader contexts in which the organization is embedded (Bierly & Spender, 1995).","18":"Similarly, fast-response medical teams must balance planned activities (e.g., reliance on protocols) with more impromptu actions (e.g., joint sensemaking and protocol breaking) (Faraj & Xiao, 2006), and firefighter strike teams balance structural mechanisms (e.g., role switching, system resetting) with constrained improvisation and cognition man- agement (e.g., communication, shifting) (Bigley & Roberts, 2001).","19":"When resources are unavailable (i.e., they are not “fungible” and not readily available to be redeployed for alternate purposes) and decision makers delay corrective action in organizational routines, organi- zational capabilities for adjustment and flexibility erode (Rahmandad & Repenning, 2016), which in- creases vulnerability to subsequent adversity.","20":"Similarly, highly skilled “ex- treme action” medical teams appeared to offer a swift, coordinated, reliable response to adversity by meld- ing hierarchical and bureaucratic role-based struc- tures through specific crisis-actions (e.g., rapid and repeated delegation, careful training of new team members), again demonstrating how resilient teams balance structure and improvisation when dealing with dynamic and unpredictable events (i.e., in this case, patients’ traumatic injuries) (Klein, Ziegert, Knight, & Xiao, 2006).","21":"For example, for some orga- nizations (e.g., nuclear submarines, air craft car- riers), avoiding failure is of paramount importance (Roberts, 1990; Roberts, Stout, & Halpern, 1994; Weick & Roberts, 1993), whereas for others, (i.e., new entrepreneurial ventures), failure is a more acceptable (although undesirable) outcome that is considered a “normal” part of the process (Ucbasaran, Shepherd, Lockett, & Lyon, 2013).","22":"As these processes play out, there is ongoing organizing and adjusting as additional threats are processed and addressed (or missed).","23":"By more quickly understanding what  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  751  1 E R U G I F  . e c n e i l i s e R d n a t n e m e g a n a M  s i s i r C  f o n o i s u F e h t  f o w e i V s s e c o r P     T N E V E S U O U N I T N O C S I D  ) k c a t t a   t s i r o r r e t   , s i s i r c   c i m o n o c e   , r e t s a s i d    , .","24":"If this is the case, what are these differences, and how does an organization or organizational member make such a switch?","25":"This research fits into a larger body of work that has made the case for renewing sensemaking as tasks and the environment continue to evolve rather than becoming stuck in one way of op- erating that prevents new interpretations of a situation (LeBaron, Christianson, Garrett, & Ilan, 2016;

[which allows researchers] to talk not only about accidents but also about organizations” (Roux- Dufort, 2007: 108) and, we add, about organizing.","20":"Crisis Management as an Activity to Restore Equilibrium  Much of the empirical research has focused on a linear progression of response stages in the after- math of a crisis event (Auf der Heide, 1989; Drabek, 1985; Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992; Pearson & Clair, 1998).","21":"These stages are seen as formulaic, sequential, and based on a bureaucratic model in which plan- ning, preparation, and hazard mitigation are co- ordinated through a centralized decision-making entity (e.g., government, organization) (Canton, 2007; Comfort, 2007; Schneider, 1992; Takeda &  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  737  Key Terms  Crisis as Event  Crisis as Process  TABLE 1 Conceptions of Crisis and Crisis Management  Crisis  c Definition: Low-probability, unanticipated, high-  impact (i.e., harmful) events that are unpredictable, surprising, and threaten the viability of the organization (Lagadec, 2007; Pearson & Clair, 1998)  c Properties  c Properties:  s Incident or accident is the unit of analysis  (Pearson & Clair, 1998)  s Events are contingencies isolated in space and  time (Lagadec, 2007)  s Possess a distinguishable origin, which has given  rise to crisis typologies (e.g., Gundel, 2005;

Pearson & Mitroff, 1993; Schneider, 1992; Waller, Lei & Pratten, 2014).","24":"Although the ef- fectiveness of crisis responses have been attributed to the interpretation of the event (Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Maitlis & Sonenshein, 2010), decision-making under high uncertainty (Anderson, 1983; Smart & Vertinsky, 1977; Tjosvold, 1984), and response strat- egies (Bechky & Okhuysen, 2011; Kahn, Barton, & Fellows, 2013), as we noted earlier in this review, there is much to be gained by exploring vulnerability to crises and the means for reducing that vulnerabil- ity (McEntire, 2013; Quarantelli, 2005).","25":"Crises are believed to represent an opportunity for managers to communi- cate with stakeholders (Barton, 1993; Simpson, Clegg, & Cunha, 2013), display leadership skills (Roux- Dufort & Lalonde, 2013; Van Wart & Kapucu, 2011), and particularly engage positive leadership (Brockner & James, 2008; James et al., 2011) so as to facilitate the organization’s progression through stages of recovery to reduce the negative effect of the crisis (Auf der Heide, 1989; Drabek, 1985).","26":"Consequently, effec- tive crisis response also involves ad hoc capabilities, such as improvising decision-making activities (Drabek, 1985; Stallings & Quarantelli, 1985) and role enactment (Webb, 2004), identifying and mobi- lizing resources (Kreps & Bosworth, 1993; Neal & Phillips, 1995; Shepherd & Williams, 2014), and establishing order through emergent communication and coordination techniques (Dynes, 2003; Wenger et al., 1990).","27":"Such groups have the potential to offer aid but may also present a num- ber of challenges (e.g., confusion over who is in charge, congestion of people and supplies that create logistical problems, mixed messages in communica- tion, and so on) (Drabek & McEntire, 2003; Wenger, Quarantelli, & Dynes, 1987).","28":"Teams and Crisis Management  In addition to leadership, many of the normative models for effectively managing crises focus on the nature of CMTs (see Mitroff, 1988; Mitroff & Pearson, 1993; Pearson & Sommer, 2011; Sapriel, 2003).","29":"For example, the effective- ness of CMTs in recovering from a crisis depends on the type and extent of training (Undre et al., 2007; Young, 1998), the development of a shared (i.e., collective) understanding (Rentsch & Klimoski, 2001; Smith-Jentsch, Campbell, Milanovich, & Reynolds, 2001), and team composition [e.g., the homogeneity of dispositional positive affect (Kaplan, Laport, & Waller, 2013)].","30":"Much of the research on these teams is grounded in ideas from the study of “high-reliability organizations” and/or organizations that are accustomed to rapidly changing environ- mental shifts (e.g., intermittent crises as a “normal” part of business) (Bierly & Spender, 1995; Bigley & Roberts, 2001; Colquitt , Lepine, Zapata, & Wild, 2011; Roberts, 1990; Weick et al., 1999).","31":"An Inclusive Conceptualization of Crisis and Crisis Management  Having examined the literatures on crisis and cri- sis management, particularly how these concepts are defined, we propose that a more inclusive defini- tion of these terms provides a basis for theoretical and empirical advancement; specifically, we offer definitions that acknowledge the complementary potential of the two conceptualizations of crises: crisis- as-event and crisis-as-process.","32":"These definitions include both the daily perturba- tions that must be overcome—strategic drift or gradual weakening over time—as well as the ex- ceptional low-probability events that dominate traditional crisis management studies (Cobb et al., 2016; Rudolph & Repenning, 2002; Turner, 1976).","33":"RESILIENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT LITERATURE  Resilience has been historically relevant in organizational scholarship (see Alexander, 2013; Linnenluecke, 2015; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Wildavsky, 1988); but, as noted earlier, it has been relatively absent in the crisis literature (Boin, et al., 2010: 11).","34":"In the mid-1500s the term passed into Middle French (r´esiler), where it came to mean “to retract” or “to cancel,” and then it moved into English as the verb resile, meaning to “return to a former position” (Alexander, 2013: 2708).","35":"Wildavsky (1988: 77) suggested that resilience is one strategy for dealing with uncertainty and risk and defined it as “the capacity to cope with unanticipated dangers as they become manifest, learning to bounce back.” Gittell, Cameron, Lim, and Rivas (2006: 303) drew on existing research to propose that resilience is a “dy- namic capacity of organizational adaptability that grows and develops over time.” In their early work,  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  741  Lengnick-Hall and Beck (2005: 750) define resilience as a capacity; “a unique blend of cognitive, behav- ioral, and contextual properties that increase a firm’s ability to understand its current situation and to de- velop customized responses that reflect that un- derstanding.” In later work, Lengnick-Hall, Beck, and Lengnick-Hall (2011: 244) define resilience as “a firm’s ability to effectively absorb, develop situation- specific responses to, and ultimately engage in transformative activities to capitalize on disruptive surprises that potentially threaten organization survival.”  In extending the logic of organizational resilience to broader systems, Boin, Comfort, and Demchak (2010: 9) define resilience as the “capacity of a social system (e.g., an organization, city, or society) to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbance.” Similarly, Hall and Lamont (2013: 33) argue that re- silient systems (society, community, etc.)","36":"Importantly, scholars in the systems tra- dition generally describe resilience has having multiple features, suggesting the workings of a dy- namic process.","37":"Much of what we know about individual resilience with a few exceptions comes from psychology (see Bonanno, 2004; Flach, 1988; Masten et al., 1990).","38":"(1990: 425) described resilience as a “process of, capacity for, or outcome of successful adaptation despite challenging or threatening cir- cumstances.” Bonanno (2004: 20) builds on this work, describing resilience as “the ability of adults in oth- erwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life- threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable,  healthy levels of psychological and physical func- tioning.” Ong et al.","39":"Kossek & Perrigino (2016: 764) go on to ar- gue that the construct “reflects the multiple ways in which individuals access resiliency resources (traits, capacity, processes of appraisal and adapta- tion, access to resources)” to respond to negative and positive stress triggers to adapt performance over one’s career.","40":"The first  \f742  Academy of Management Annals  June  issue, illustrated particularly in definitions of em- ployee resilience, pertains to the basic essence of resilience—whether it is a trait, a capacity, or a pro- cess.","41":"Resilience as an interactive process of re- lational adaptation has to do with understanding, responding to, and absorbing variations; maintain- ing, gaining back, and/or building new resources.","42":"(2015: 971) argue that organiza- tional resilience is required “in our daily lives” as well as “to shape and mitigate the consequences of [adversity] when they occur.”  A third issue pertains to the point at which resil- ience is most important—what Boin et al.","43":"However, if we think of resilience as a process, and couple it with the crisis-as-process perspective, resilience naturally would be situated earlier.","44":"A mark of resilience is “the ability to negotiate flux without succumbing to it” (Boin et al., 2010: 8).","45":"In Table 2 we summarize the origins, derivations, and conceptions of resilience across areas of inquiry.","46":"These include elements of resilience that pertain to resource endowments, organizing prac- tices, and postcrisis response.","47":"Capabilities for Durability: Resource Endowments Actors’ various capabilities can facilitate interac- tions with the environment that enable adjustment to adversity.","48":"Capabilities are knowledge, skills, abili- ties, and processes (i.e., routines) that facilitate access to and manipulation of resources (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).","49":"Capabilities for durability refer to the endowments actors possess prior to ad- versity that shape their capacity for positive adjust- ment (Bonanno et al., 2010; Hobfoll, 1989; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003) and represent the first prominent theme in the resilience literature.","50":"Although scholars acknowledge the presence of individual-level trait- based resilience effects (Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000), prominent theories of stress (Bonanno, 2004; Hobfoll, 1989) propose that developing and acquiring  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  743  TABLE 2 Origins, Derivations, and Conceptions of Resilience across Areas of Inquiry  Category  Definition  Origins and derivationsa  c Resilire, resilio (Latin): referring to “bounce” or “to leap” (Manyena et al., 2011).","51":"Psychology  Ecology  c Equilibrium and stability of systems (Holling, 1973)  s “Leaping, jumping, or rebounding” [Natural History, Pliny the Elder (Alexander, 2013: 2708)].","52":"Perpetuated by St. Jerome (AD 347–420) c R ´esiler (French): “to retract” or “to cancel” c Resile (English): state papers of King Henry VIII, 1529): “Retract,” “return to a former position” c Resilement.","53":". . A resilient system is one that can adapt, be creative and flexible, but also is able to self-regulate and have processes and routines capable of handling complexity without oversimplifying.","54":"Endowments facilitate resil- ience by enabling adaptability (Gittell et al., 2006; Pal, Torstensson, & Mattila, 2014), providing for positive coping, and offering means by which an actor (i.e., individual, organization, or community) “interprets and responds to new challenges” in a positive way (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003: 97).","55":"In addition to financial and material resources, positive functioning is main- tained by other endowments, including cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and relational capabilities.","56":"The ability to quickly assimilate new information helps individuals in- terpret and navigate the altered environment (Aitken & Morgan, 1999) and is crucial in directing attention (Langer, 1989; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006).","57":"Indeed, ad- versity has the potential to shatter fundamental as- sumptions about oneself, the environment, and one’s belief in cause–effect relationships (Beder, 2005; Haynie & Shepherd, 2011; Janoff-Bulman, 1992).","58":"Individuals and organizations are there- fore likely to enhance resilience to adversity by culti- vating endowments of emotional capital, which could include (individual and/or collective) optimism, hope, and opportunities to appropriately express and discuss emotions (Amabile, Barsade, Mueller, & Staw, 2005; Barsade & Knight, 2015).","59":"Emotions  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  745  play a functional role in facilitating how actors make sense of and assign meaning to their envi- ronment (Weick et al., 2005).","60":"The psychology literature—exemplified by the work of Fredrickson and colleagues (e.g., Fredrickson, 2001; Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003; Hayward et al., 2010)—has examined how individuals with high resilience differ from those with lower resilience, particularly in terms of experiencing and using emotions.","61":"For example, Stephens, Heaphy, Carmeli, Spreitzer, and Dutton (2013: 15) found that group resilience was directly tied to emo- tional carrying capacity, or “the relationship’s ca- pacity to express more emotions overall, both positive and negative .","62":". . in a constructive manner.” Further- more, emotional capabilities can be generated by cultivating a broad organization-wide culture of an “ethic of care” enacted through narrative practices that document positive experiences, contextualize challenges, and develop future-oriented stories; these narratives foster an “ontology of possibility” that fa- cilitates resilience (Lawrence & Maitlis, 2012: 641).","63":"Specifically, emotional ambivalence likely enables resilience to both swift, unexpected events (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2015), and “weak signals of failure” that, when recognized and acted upon, help avoid organizational crisis (Vogus et al., 2014: 593).","64":"In the con- text of adversity, relational capabilities—the social connections that enable access to and exchange of resources—play an important role in shaping im- mediate actions and ultimately enabling positive functioning in the face of adversity.","65":"In a related study, Williams and Shepherd (2016b) found that prior knowledge of and experi- ence with entrepreneurial activity further facilitated  1 Despite these potential benefits, emotional ambiva- lence could also have a potential downside in that it leads to more deliberation in decision making (i.e., consumes more time) and can result in biased information processing in attempts to resolve the ambivalence (Nordgren, van Harreveld, & van der Pligt, 2006).","66":"Preadversity Organizing: Preparing and Restoring  The second prominent theme in the resilience lit- erature relates to organizing processes aimed at antic- ipating, preventing, or mitigating “potential dangers before damage is done” (Wildavsky, 1988: 77) and adjusting to deal with unexpected or unknown con- tingencies and emerging breakdowns so as to lower the likelihood that these disruptions will grow into trig- gering events.","67":"This proactive “in- vestment” orientation toward potential adversity likely helps “reduce the short- and long-term negative social and economic impacts on people’s lives and business” (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015: 977).","68":"Effective and timely identification of and response to emerging chal- lenges is particularly important for some organiza- tions in some industries or contexts.","69":"From this high-reliability perspective, resilience involves improvising and using generic resources described in the prior section (e.g., knowledge, communi- cation, financial resources, emotional, relational, structural capacities) to avoid a catastrophe or to mitigate its evolution.","70":"2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  747  Research has also investigated preparation, role structuring, and coordination by emergency re- sponders and/or response groups as an important as- pect of resilience.","71":"Forming a positive cognitive response to surprising events  \f748  Academy of Management Annals  June  appears to require individuals to rapidly direct their attention from structures to meaning (and back again) as an input for either reaffirming or reconstructing their interpretive systems (Weick, 1993: 646).","72":"Organizations have different levels of social con- nectivity and varied information-sharing mecha- nisms, which may impact their resilience.","73":"Beyond individual organizations, different com- munities may have varied levels of social capital that enable or constrain resilience.","74":"Bridging social capital—namely, weak, sparsely connected yet di- verse ties—on the other hand, facilitates access to novel information and resources (Burt, 1992) and accelerates long-term recovery (Hawkins & Maurer, 2010).","75":"Prior ex- periences with adversity appear to be linked to sub- sequent resilience, but there is considerable variance in the nature of this relationship (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000; Bonanno, Westphal, & Mancini, 2011).","76":"Therefore, resilience can be facilitated by learning from experience with adver- sity, and this learning—as individual organizational members encode new information, adjust mental models, and encode new knowledge into organiza- tional routines—can be direct or vicarious (Madsen, 2009).","77":"In summary, the literature emphasizes that resil- ience evolves over time as the actor (i.e., individual, organization, or community) interacts with the envi- ronment (i.e., adversity), highlighting the dynamism of resilience.","78":"INTEGRATING CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND RESILIENCE—FRAMING FUTURE RESEARCH  Our reviews of the two literatures suggest that in many ways, crisis management and resilience are two aspects of the same challenge—the challenge of adversity.","79":"This updating and the im- portance of time are evidenced in social media, in which a crisis can arise in a matter of hours if the proper detection and responses are not enacted (Gruber, Smerek, Thomas-Hunt, & James, 2015).","80":"The real-time speed and public nature of platforms like Twitter mean that organizations need to be more vigilant and re- sponsive.","81":"Similarly, in their study of a French bank, Chekkar-Mansouri and Onnee (2013) found that double-loop learning and organization- level-focused learning policies helped reduce the vul- nerability of the bank to recurrent adversity.","82":"754  Academy of Management Annals  June  Third, when preparing for and responding to ad- versity, much is made of speed.","83":"The answer may lie with the current list of endowments, other endow- ments not currently recognized in the literature, and/ or some other spontaneous mechanisms of acceler- ation.","84":"Future Research on Complexity and Adversity  The increasing complexity, dynamism, and inter- connectedness of contemporary business environ- ments coupled with increasing information-processing requirements tend to intensify the impact of adversity on organizations (Lagadec, 2009; Topper & Lagadec, 2013).","85":"As an example of the evolving complexity in the environment, the microblogging website Twitter now sees the “one-in-a million chance of something going horribly wrong 500 times a day” (Hill, 2014).","86":"Indeed, despite the potential connection, our sys- tematic review did not uncover “control theory” as a substantial research theme in the crisis and resil- ience literatures.","87":"We anticipate that future research might explore how organizations design mecha- nisms of “control” that involve responding to dis- turbances that “fall outside the range of normal and [the] expected” (Boin, Comfort, & Demchak, 2010: 9).","88":"Is it possible to build re- silient controls and if so, how can these be used to build resilient organizations, systems, and commu- nities (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015)?","89":"Past studies have suggested that both the sheer number and degree of incompatibility of different institutional logics— beliefs and practices that guide and shape individual/ organizational identities and actions (Thornton, Ocasio, & Lounsbury, 2012)—contribute to environ- mental complexity (Greenwood et al., 2011).","90":"Future Research on Mindfulness and Adversity  As we have argued, various new contingencies, such as breakdowns in information and communication  \f756  Academy of Management Annals  June  systems, have increased uncertainty and vulnera- bility for all organizations.","91":"Thus, re- search has suggested that mindfulness and the pro- cesses through which it is enabled fuel resilience.","92":"More rig- orous studies examining the effects of mindful or- ganizing on resilience are needed, particularly in more prosaic organizational settings and contexts outside high-risk industries.","93":"Clearly, resil- ience has its benefits in enabling actors to maintain functioning in the face of adversity (Bonanno, 2004; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Van Der Vegt et al., 2015).","94":". . yet may be incompatible with an honest acknowledgement of failure, and thus, while promoting happiness, can inhibit learning” (Cannon & Edmondson, 2005: 302).","95":"Perhaps  \f2017  Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, and Zhao  757  certain types of adversity (e.g., self-caused adversity, such as errors or personal failure) result in lower levels of learning for more resilient actors vis-a-vis those who experience the adversity as a major disruption.","96":"Second, and related to the previous point, resil- ience assists actors in persisting in activities despite hardship.","97":"Further- more, at the system or institutional level, an outpouring of well-meaning yet uncoordinated response efforts can result in the “mass assault” of decentralized activities (Perry, 1991: 202), including overabundance of volunteers, congestion of people and vehicles, information overload, and inability to effectively divide tasks and jurisdictional bound- aries (Drabek, 1985; Quarantelli, 1986; Wenger et al., 1987).","98":"Do the social-liability characteristics associated with indi- vidual resilience transfer to the team or organizational levels of analysis?","99":"Does a leader’s emotional disassociation generate organi- zational resilience but at the cost of personal and/or organizational member functioning?","100":"Finally, individual and organizational resilience can be purposely nurtured and developed (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Wildavsky, 1988), but doing so can be time and resource consuming (Dewald & Bowen, 2010).","101":"Advancements in research on resil- ience need to account for differences in attention to adversity and link them to the capabilities, pro- cesses, and responses that constitute resilience.","102":"CONCLUSION  In this review and integration, we have sought to move crisis management away from its focus on ex- ceptional (i.e., low-probability) events and integrate it with the concept of resilience.","103":"By fusing these two literatures, we are in a better position to understand why some organi- zations successfully adjust to and even thrive amid adversity, whereas others fail to do so and how or- ganizations transform their resilient capacities and capabilities into resilient functioning."},"color":{"r":240,"g":178,"b":122}}}
